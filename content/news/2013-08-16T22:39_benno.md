# Candidates Are In

The [AEC](http://aec.gov.au/) has released the official candidate nominations
today, along with the ballot orderings. These are now live on the site. All
candidate lists are now in ballot order, including the Senate lists on the
state pages. The group voting tickets are due to be released over the weekend
and we'll have them up, along with the ballot editors, as soon as we can after
that.
