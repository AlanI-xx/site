# Editors Are Live

The ballot editors are live and linked from the division pages. We're sorry
for the delay but we wanted to make sure everything worked well. Let us know
if you find anything wrong.

As often happens in software development it's when you try to put the last
things together that everything goes wrong. Michael had been working on the
ballot editor set up, I'd been working on the PDF renderer and various bits
of code for ingesting the AEC data and naturally when we went to put it all
together we ran into a bunch of issues that weren't dramatically bad but were
enough that we didn't feel right putting the editors live yesterday. We've
worked through these issues now and we hope you'll find the results useful.
